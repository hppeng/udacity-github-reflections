What happens when you initialize a repository? 

It creates a git repository locally.

Why do you need to do it?
So we can start having revision control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 

It is a buffer area where you can store meaningful logic changes before committing. It is just a buffer for you to think about reasonable changes you want to commit in one shot.

What value do you think it offers?

It offers places for reflection.
